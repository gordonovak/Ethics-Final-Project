          For our project we are going to be looking into the issue of
          cybersecurity in healthcare.<br>
      </div>
      
      <div class="center1">
        <p>With the advancement of electronic healthcare technology, utility for technological integration with healthcare services brings with it an emerging potential to improve clinical functionality and outcomes across the globe. However, healthcare is an appealing target for cybercrime, particularly because it has a plethora of valuable data and defences are weak (Lynne). The havoc cybersecurity vulnerabilities could expose the healthcare industry to include, but are not limited to:</p></div>
          Stealing Health Information
          Can be used to impersonate/blackmail civilians
          Ransomware Attacks
          Can be used to blackmail/harm healthcare facilities
          Attacks on Medical Implants
          Can be used to seriously injure/kill patients reliant on implants
          <p>All of these possibilities serve to weaken patient trust, cripple healthcare systems, and severely injure or kill patients, and the threats are real. This indicates that system security, especially in the healthcare sector, is increasingly critical, yet legislation has historically remained lenient and unspecific.

        Just in February 2025, the Cayuga Medical Center in NY suffered a
        cyberattack which crippled their technological systems and forced
        multiple patients to either have care delayed or be transferred to a
        different facility. So it's important not only to deal with these
        issues, but inform the public and US Legislature of these issues so
        that they will not be repeated.
