                    <p>For our project we are going to be looking into the issue of cybersecurity in healthcare. 
                        Recently, there have been a large number of issues with cyberattacks on multiple healthcare and insurance providers. 
                        Change Healthcare, which was related to over ⅓ of Americans, suffered a data breach so large that hospitals & insurance companies across the country suffered financial losses and malfunction within multiple healthcare sectors.
                        Just in February 2025, the Cayuga Medical Center in NY suffered a cyberattack which crippled their technological systems and forced multiple patients to either have care delayed or be transferred to a different facility.
                        So it’s important not only to deal with these issues, but inform the public and US Legislature of these issues so that they will not be repeated.
