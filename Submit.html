            <p>Wether you were succesful or not we hope you understand the difficulty of the module. <br><br>
              There are many tough decisions that need to be made in order to best protect your patients' data. <br>
              It'd be much easier if we were just able to have strong security in all cases with all budgets.<br><br> 
              This is why it is extremely important to have cybersecurity standards so sensitive patient data is not vulnerable to attacks. Not only should the government enforce these standards but companies should also want to have even stronger cybersecurity methods in order to gain patients' trust and prevent sensitive data from being shared with the public.<br><br>
              Note that <i><b>none of the cybersecurity measures listed on the last page are required in the US by healthcare companies.</b></i> The primary motivation for preventing these attacks is public perception and not legal repurcussion (despite it being a possibility.)<br><br>
              Cyberattacks can directly impact people's lives and cause major issues that take years to fix. They also cost the company who the attack was against a lot of money for cleaning up and repairing their systems. This is an essential ethical issue in the tech world that should be resolved by healthcare companies investing as much money and resources as possible in order to keep the thousands of people who come into their medical facilities as patients, sensitive patient data safe. </p>
